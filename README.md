# Quick Loadout Switch

Use the arrow keys to quickly switch your loadout.

## Install

Download or clone this repo. Move `loadout_switch.cfg` into your config folder, e.g.:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\rufio-config\cfg\ANY\OTHER\FOLDERS\loadout_switch.cfg
```

Execute it in your `autoexec.cfg`:

```
// Add this line to your autoexec.cfg, matching the path you used above (starting after `cfg\`):
exec ANY\OTHER\FOLDERS\loadout_switch
```

## Notes

I'm working on pulling out of the main config all of the stuff that's specific to my settings, so that someone can install the core functionality without adopting all of my specific settings.
